*    Brother Honeycutt, CS124
* Author:
*    Fernando Negreiros Henriques
* Summary:
*    This is my first assignment for C++ programming class.
*    It will display the phrase Hello World on the Screen.
*    Before you begin working, estimate the time you think it will
*    take you to do the assignment and include it in this header block.
*    Before you submit the assignment include the actual time it took.
*
*    Estimated:  1.0 hrs   
*    Actual:     2.0 hrs
*      It is not a difficult program, but
*   I had been taking too much time correcting the Header
*   with this not properly made the assignment can`t be sent.
